- The default index selection mode was selected which gives priority to filtering over sorting.
- The selected index is 'date_account'. The steps of the query are:
    - Index levels:
        - 1. date: Select one (exact match)
        - 2. account_id: Sort by (full scan)
    - Apply flex filtering.
    - Apply the sorting directives inside the packets, which weren't used for an index level:
        - cost
    - Return the complete result.
